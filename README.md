# TerminalConfig

It's my multy platform terminal configurations for Alacritty and Starship with FiraCode Nerd Font.

## Alacritty

Light weight and highly customisable terminal emulator for Mac, Linux and Windows.

The configuration contains color schemes for Nord and Synthwave '84 themes.

## Starship

The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!

## FiraCode Nerd Font

Briliant monospace font for terminal and programing, enhanced with elegant emoticons.
